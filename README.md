# Cowsay Moo
This is an improved version of the classic `cowsay` program of days old, fixing
a grevous shortcoming of not being able to make the cow say a cow. This has now
been fixed with `cowsay_moo`! 

To run the program, all you need is a Rust toolchain and `cargo` installed. 
Everything else is handled for you. 

To build:
```
-$ cargo build --release
```

The executable will be found under `target/release/cowsay_moo`

```
